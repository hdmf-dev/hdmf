- Relaxed input validation of `HDF5IO` to allow for s3fs support. Existing arguments of `HDF5IO` are modified as follows: i) `mode` was given a default value of "r", ii) `path` was given a default value of `None`, and iii) `file` can now accept an `S3File` type argument. @bendichter ([#746](https://github.com/hdmf-dev/hdmf/pull/746))
- Added ability to create and get back handle to empty HDF5 dataset. @ajtritt ([#747](https://github.com/hdmf-dev/hdmf/pull/747))
- Added `AbstractContainer._in_construct_mode` that is set and modified only by the ObjectMapper when constructing an
  object from a builder read from a file. Subclasses of `AbstractContainer` can check `_in_construct_mode`
  during the initialization phase as part of ``__init__`` to distinguish between actions during construction
  (i.e., read from disk) vs. creation by the user, e.g., to determine whether to raise a warning or error when
  encountering invalid data to support reading and correcting data that is invalid while preventing creation
  of new data that is invalid. @rly ([#751](https://github.com/hdmf-dev/hdmf/pull/751))

- Allow `zarr.Array` as array datatype in docval to support conversion data stored in Zarr to HDMF HDF5 data. @oruebel (#721)
- Allow `hdmf.common.table.DynamicTable.add_column` to accept nested lists as column data and automatically create the `VectorIndex` and `VectorData` objects required to represent the ragged array. @oruebel (#728)
- Added a warning when the ``__init__`` of a class mapped to an HDMF-common data type or an autogenerated data type class
  is passed positional arguments instead of all keyword arguments. @rly (#730)
- Added helper function `hdmf.utils.popargs_to_dict` for popping docval args into a dict. @rly (#732)

- Allow `write_args=None` to be passed to `HDF5IO.export`. @rly (#733)
- Updated requirements and fixed minor documentation issues and warnings. @rly (#731)

### Test enhancements
- Moved test functions to ease reuse and updated tests accordingly. @oruebel (#697)
- Moved `Baz`, `BazData`, `BazCpdData`, `BazBucket`, `get_baz_buildmanager` test data classes from `tests.unit.test_io_hdf5_h5tools` to `tests.unit.utils` to ease reuse and updated tests accordingly. Also `_get_baz_manager` was renamed to `get_baz_buildmanager` as part of this move. @oruebel (#697)
- Added numerous tests to `tests/unit/common/test_sparse.py` to enhance testing of the `CSRMatrix` type. @oruebel (#697)

### Documentation and tutorial enhancements:
- Add copy button to code blocks. @weiglszonja @oruebel (#726)

  objects rather than lists of dicts. @oruebel (#660)

## HDMF 3.1.0 (July 29, 2021)

### New features
- Added several features to simplify interaction with ``DynamicTable`` objects that link to other tables via
  ``DynamicTableRegion`` columns. @oruebel (#645)
    - Added ``DynamicTable.get_foreign_columns`` to find all columns in a table that are a ``DynamicTableRegion``

      - ``drop_id_columns`` to remove "id" columns from a DataFrame.
      - ``flatten_column_index`` to replace a ``pandas.MultiIndex`` with a regular ``pandas.Index``

### Bug fixes
- Do not build wheels compatible with Python 2 because HDMF requires Python 3.7. @rly (#642)
- ``AlignedDynamicTable`` did not overwrite its ``get`` function. When using ``DynamicTableRegion`` to reference ``AlignedDynamicTable`` this led to cases where the columns of the category subtables where omitted during data access (e.g., conversion to pandas.DataFrame). This fix adds the ``AlignedDynamicTable.get`` based on the existing ``AlignedDynamicTable.__getitem__``. @oruebel (#645)
- Fixed #651 to support selection of cells in an ``AlignedDynamicTable`` via slicing with  ``[int, (str, str)]``(and ``[int, str, str]``) to select a single cell, and ``[int, str]`` to select a single row of a category table. @oruebel (#645)

### Minor improvements
- Updated ``DynamicTable.to_dataframe()`` and ``DynamicTable.get`` functions to set the ``.name`` attribute
  on generated pandas DataFrame objects. @oruebel (#645)
- Added ``AlignedDynamicTable.get_colnames(...)`` to support look-up of the full list of columns as the
  ``AlignedDynamicTable.colnames`` property only includes the columns of the main table for compliance with
  ``DynamicTable`` @oruebel (#645)
- Fix documentation for `DynamicTable.get` and `DynamicTableRegion.get`. @rly (#650)
- Allow passing string column name to `DynamicTableRegion`, i.e., `dtr['col_name']` is a shortcut to
  `dtr.table['col_name']`. @rly (#657)

## HDMF 3.0.1 (July 7, 2021)

### Bug fixes
- Fixed release CI that prevented distribution from being uploaded to PyPI. @rly (#641)

## HDMF 3.0.0 (July 6, 2021)

### New features
- Add support for Python 3.9, drop support for Python 3.6. @rly (#620)
- Add support for h5py 3. @ajtritt (#480)
  - h5py 3 introduced [breaking changes regarding how strings are handled]
  (https://docs.h5py.org/en/latest/whatsnew/3.0.html#breaking-changes-deprecations), specifically that
  variable-length UTF-8 strings in datasets are now read as `bytes` objects instead of `str` by default.
  To reduce the impact of this change on HDMF users, when HDMF reads a variable-length UTF-8 string
  dataset, instead of returning an `h5py.Dataset` that is read as `bytes` objects, HDMF will return a
  `hdmf.utils.StrDataset` object that extends `h5py.Dataset` and is read as `str` objects, which preserves
  previous behavior. For example, under HDMF 2.x, an HDF5 dataset `d` with data ['a', 'b'] is read as a
  `h5py.Dataset` object, and `d[:]` returns `str` objects. Under HDMF 3.x, the same dataset `d` is read
  as a `hdmf.utils.StrDataset` object and `d[:]` still returns `str` objects.
- Add RRID to docs. @oruebel (#633)
- Allow passing ``index=True`` to ``DynamicTable.to_dataframe()`` to support returning `DynamicTableRegion` columns
  as indices or Pandas DataFrame. @rly (#579)
- Improve ``DynamicTable`` documentation. @rly (#639)
- Updated external resources tutorial. @mavaylon (#611)

### Breaking changes and deprecations
- Previously, when using ``DynamicTable.__getitem__`` or ``DynamicTable.get`` to access a selection of a
  ``DynamicTable`` containing a ``DynamicTableRegion``, new columns with mangled names for the table data referred to
  by the ``DynamicTableRegion`` were added to the returned DataFrame. This did not work properly for ragged
  ``DynamicTableRegion``, multiple levels of nesting, or multiple rows returned.
  Now, these methods will by default return columns of indices of the ``DynamicTableRegion``. If ``index=False`` is
  passed to ``DynamicTable.get``, then nested DataFrames will be returned, one DataFrame per row of the original
  resulting DataFrame. @rly (#579)

### Minor improvements
- Updated requirements and tests. @rly (#640)

### Bug fixes
- Update the validator to allow extensions to data types which only define data_type_inc. @dsleiter (#609)
- Fix error when validating lazy-loaded datasets containing references. @dsleiter (#609)
- Fix error when using ``DynamicTable.__getitem__`` or ``DynamicTable.get`` when table has a ragged
  ``DynamicTableRegion``. @rly (#579)

## HDMF 2.5.8 (June 16, 2021)
- Fix incorrect dtype precision upgrade for VectorIndex (#631)

### Minor improvements
- Improve Sphinx documentation. @rly (#627)

### Bug fix
- Fix error with representing an indexed table column when the `VectorIndex` dtype precision is upgraded more
  than one step, e.g., uint8 to uint32. This can happen when, for example, a single `add_row` call is used to
  add more than 65535 elements to an empty indexed column. @rly (#631)

## HDMF 2.5.7 (June 4, 2021)

### Bug fix
- Fix generation of extension classes that extend `MultiContainerInterface` and use a custom _fieldsname. @rly (#626)

## HDMF 2.5.6 (May 19, 2021)

### Bug fix
- Raise minimum version of pandas from 0.23 to 1.0.5 to be compatible with numpy 1.20. @rly (#618)

## HDMF 2.5.5 (May 17, 2021)

### Bug fix
- Fix incompatibility issue with downstream github-release tool used to deploy releases to GitHub. @rly (#614)

## HDMF 2.5.4 (May 17, 2021)

### Bug fix
- Fix incompatibility issue with downstream github-release tool used to deploy releases to GitHub. @rly (#607)
- Fix issue where dependencies of included types were not being loaded in namespaces / extensions. @rly (#613)

## HDMF 2.5.3 (May 12, 2021)

### Bug fix
- Fix issue where tables with multi-indexed columns defined using `__columns__` did not have attributes properly set.
  @rly (#605)

## HDMF 2.5.2 (May 11, 2021)

### Bug fix
- Add explicit `setuptools` requirement. @hrnciar (#596)
- Fix issue with generated custom classes that use a custom fields name (e.g., PyNWB uses `__nwbfields__` instead
  of `__fields__`). @rly (#598)
- Fix issue with Sphinx Gallery. @rly (#601)

## HDMF 2.5.1 (April 23, 2021)

### Bug fix
- Revert breaking change in `TypeMap.get_container_cls`. While this function is returned to its original behavior,
  it will be modified at the next major release. Please use the new `TypeMap.get_dt_container_cls` instead. @rly (#590)

## HDMF 2.5.0 (April 22, 2021)

### New features
- `DynamicTable` can be automatically generated using `get_class`. Now the HDMF API can read files with extensions
  that contain a `DynamicTable` without needing to import the extension first. @rly and @bendichter (#536)
- Add `HDF5IO.get_namespaces(path=path, file=file)` method which returns a dict of namespace name mapped to the
  namespace version (the largest one if there are multiple) for each namespace cached in the given HDF5 file.
  @rly (#527)
- Use HDMF common schema 1.5.0.
  - Add experimental namespace to HDMF common schema. New data types should go in the experimental namespace
    (hdmf-experimental) prior to being added to the core (hdmf-common) namespace. The purpose of this is to provide
    a place to test new data types that may break backward compatibility as they are refined. @ajtritt (#545)
  - `ExternalResources` was changed to support storing both names and URIs for resources. @mavaylon (#517, #548)
  - The `VocabData` data type was replaced by `EnumData` to provide more flexible support for data from a set of
    fixed values.
  - Added `AlignedDynamicTable`, which defines a `DynamicTable` that supports storing a collection of sub-tables.
    Each sub-table is itself a `DynamicTable` that is aligned with the main table by row index. Each sub-table
    defines a sub-category in the main table effectively creating a table with sub-headings to organize columns.
  - See https://hdmf-common-schema.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format_release_notes.html#april-19-2021 for more
    details.
- Add `EnumData` type for storing data that comes from a fixed set of values. This replaces `VocabData` i.e.
  `VocabData` has been removed. `VocabData` stored vocabulary elements in an attribute, which has a size limit.
  `EnumData` now stores elements in a separate dataset, referenced by an attribute stored on the `EnumData` dataset.
  @ajtritt (#537)
- Add `AlignedDynamicTable` type which defines a DynamicTable that supports storing a collection of subtables.
  Each sub-table is itself a DynamicTable that is aligned with the main table by row index. Each subtable
  defines a sub-category in the main table effectively creating a table with sub-headings to organize columns.
  @oruebel (#551)
- Add tutoral for new `AlignedDynamicTable` type. @oruebel (#571)
- Equality check for `DynamicTable` now also checks that the name and description of the table are the same. @rly (#566)

### Internal improvements
- Update CI and copyright year. @rly (#523, #524)
- Refactor class generation code. @rly (#533, #535)
- Equality check for `DynamicTable` returns False if the other object is a `DynamicTable` instead of raising an error.
  @rly (#566)
- Update ruamel.yaml usage to new API. @rly (#587)
- Remove use of ColoredTestRunner for more readable verbose test output. @rly (#588)

### Bug fixes

- Various fixes for dynamic class generation. @rly (#561)
- Fix generation of classes that extends both `MultiContainerInterface` and another class that extends
  `MultiContainerInterface`. @rly (#567)
- Fix `make clean` command for docs to clean up sphinx-gallery tutorial files. @oruebel (#571)
- Make sure we cannot set ``AlignedDynamicTable`` as a category on an ``AlignedDynamicTable``. @oruebel (#571)
- Fix included data type resolution between HDMF and custom classes that customize the data_type_inc key. @rly (#503)
- Fix classification of attributes as new/overridden. @rly (#503)

## HDMF 2.4.0 (February 23, 2021)

  `OrphanContainerBuildError` will be raised. This replaces the `OrphanContainerWarning` that was previously raised.
  @rly (#407)

## HDMF 2.0.0 (July 17, 2020)

### New features
- Users can now call `HDF5IO.export` and `HDF5IO.export_io` to write data that was read from one source to a new HDF5
  file. Developers can implement the `export` method in classes that extend `HDMFIO` to customize the export
  functionality. See https://hdmf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/export.html for more details. @rly (#388)
- Users can use the new export functionality to read data from one source, modify the data in-memory, and then write the
  modified data to a new file. Modifications can include additions and removals. To facilitate removals,
  `AbstractContainer` contains a new `_remove_child` method and `BuildManager` contains a new `purge_outdated` method.
  @rly (#388)
- Users can now call `Container.generate_new_id` to generate new object IDs for the container and all of its children.
  @rly (#401)
- Use hdmf-common-schema 1.2.0. @ajtritt @rly (#397)
