groups:
- data_type_def: Container
  doc: An abstract data type for a generic container storing collections of data and
    metadata. Base type for all data and metadata containers.

- data_type_def: DynamicTable
  data_type_inc: Container
  doc: A group containing multiple datasets that are aligned on the first dimension
    (Currently, this requirement if left up to APIs to check and enforce). Apart from
    a column that contains unique identifiers for each row there are no other required
    datasets. Users are free to add any number of VectorData objects here. Table functionality
    is already supported through compound types, which is analogous to storing an
    array-of-structs. DynamicTable can be thought of as a struct-of-arrays. This provides
    an alternative structure to choose from when optimizing storage for anticipated
    access patterns. Additionally, this type provides a way of creating a table without
    having to define a compound type up front. Although this convenience may be attractive,
    users should think carefully about how data will be accessed. DynamicTable is
    more appropriate for column-centric access, whereas a dataset with a compound
    type would be more appropriate for row-centric access. Finally, data size should
    also be taken into account. For small tables, performance loss may be an acceptable
    trade-off for the flexibility of a DynamicTable. For example, DynamicTable was
    originally developed for storing trial data and spike unit metadata. Both of these
    use cases are expected to produce relatively small tables, so the spatial locality
    of multiple datasets present in a DynamicTable is not expected to have a significant
    performance impact. Additionally, requirements of trial and unit metadata tables
    are sufficiently diverse that performance implications can be overlooked in favor
    of usability.
