          rise to basket-like structures that surround the soma of the target cell.

          throughout the body; types include melanocytes, the cells of the chromaffin
          system, and cells in the hypothalamus, hypophysis, thyroid, parathyroids,
          lungs, gastrointestinal tract, and pancreas. This cell type concentrates
          the amino acid precursors of certain amines and decarboxylate them, forming
          amines that function as regulators and neurotransmitters. This cell type
          produces substances such as epinephrine, norepinephrine, dopamine, serotonin,
          enkephalin, somatostatin, neurotensin, and substance P, the actions of which
          may affect contiguous cells, nearby groups of cells, or distant cells, thus
