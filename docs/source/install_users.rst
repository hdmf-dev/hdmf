Installing HDMF
---------------

HDMF requires having Python 3.8, 3.9, 3.10, 3.11, or 3.12 installed. If you don't have Python installed and want the simplest way to
get started, we recommend you install and use the `Anaconda Distribution`_. It includes Python, NumPy, and many other
commonly used packages for scientific computing and data science.

HDMF can be installed with ``pip``, ``conda``, or from source. HDMF works on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

Option 1: Using pip
-------------------

If you are a beginner to programming in Python and using Python tools, we recommend that you install HDMF by running
the following command in a terminal or command prompt:

.. code::

   pip install hdmf

Option 2: Using conda
---------------------

You can also install HDMF using ``conda`` by running the following command in a terminal or command prompt:

.. code::

   conda install -c conda-forge hdmf
