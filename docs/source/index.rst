The Hierarchical Data Modeling Framework
========================================

HDMF is a Python package for working with standardizing, reading, and writing hierarchical object data.

HDMF is a by product of the `Neurodata Without Borders: Neurophysiology (NWB:N) <http://www.nwb.org/>`_ project.
The goal of NWB:N was to enable collaborative science within the neurophysiology and systems neuroscience communities
through data standardization. The team of neuroscientists and software developers involved with NWB:N
recognize that adoption of a unified data format is an important step toward breaking down the barriers to
data sharing in neuroscience. HDMF was central the NWB:N development efforts, and has since been split off
with the intention of providing it as an open-source tool for other scientific communities.
