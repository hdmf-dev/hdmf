The Hierarchical Data Modeling Framework
========================================

HDMF is a Python package for working with standardizing, reading, and writing hierarchical object data.

HDMF is a by-product of the `Neurodata Without Borders (NWB) <https://www.nwb.org/>`_ project.
The goal of NWB was to enable collaborative science within the neurophysiology and systems neuroscience communities
through data standardization. The team of neuroscientists and software developers involved with NWB
recognize that adoption of a unified data format is an important step toward breaking down the barriers to
data sharing in neuroscience. HDMF was central to the NWB development efforts, and has since been split off
with the intention of providing it as an open-source tool for other scientific communities.
